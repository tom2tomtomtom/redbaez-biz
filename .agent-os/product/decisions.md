## 2025-07-30: Initial Product Planning - Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Product  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement Agent OS framework for Red Baez Business Suite, a task forecasting and productivity optimization platform targeting independent professionals, small business owners, and digital agencies. Focus on AI-powered workload prediction, velocity tracking, and workflow optimization without enterprise complexity.

### Context

The platform has reached a mature state with comprehensive CRM, task management, AI content generation, and business intelligence capabilities already implemented. Installing Agent OS will provide structured development workflows, comprehensive documentation, and systematic feature development processes as the platform scales and adds advanced forecasting capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue Ad-hoc Development**
   - Pros: No process overhead, maximum flexibility, faster short-term development
   - Cons: Reduced documentation quality, inconsistent development patterns, difficulty onboarding new team members

2. **Implement Custom Development Framework**
   - Pros: Tailored specifically to project needs, complete control over processes
   - Cons: High development overhead, reinventing established patterns, maintenance burden

3. **Adopt Enterprise Project Management Tools**
   - Pros: Full-featured project management, established enterprise patterns
   - Cons: Excessive complexity for small team, doesn't align with agile development needs

### Rationale

Agent OS provides the optimal balance of structure and flexibility for this stage of product development. The platform has substantial existing functionality that needs systematic enhancement, and Agent OS workflows will ensure quality and consistency as advanced forecasting features are implemented.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured development workflows improve code quality and feature consistency
- Comprehensive documentation facilitates team collaboration and knowledge transfer
- TDD approach ensures robust testing coverage for critical forecasting algorithms
- Systematic spec creation reduces feature scope creep and improves delivery predictability

**Negative:**
- Initial process overhead while team adapts to Agent OS workflows
- Additional documentation maintenance requirements
- Potential short-term development velocity reduction during workflow adoption

## 2025-01-30: Technology Stack Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt React + TypeScript + Supabase architecture with shadcn/ui components, React Query for state management, and Supabase Edge Functions for AI processing.

### Context

Platform required rapid development capabilities with type safety, real-time data synchronization, and AI processing capabilities. The technology choices needed to support independent professional workflows with minimal infrastructure management overhead.

### Rationale

- **React + TypeScript**: Provides type safety and component reusability essential for complex dashboard interfaces
- **Supabase**: Eliminates backend infrastructure management while providing real-time capabilities and Edge Functions for AI processing
- **shadcn/ui**: Ensures consistent, accessible design system with minimal customization overhead
- **React Query**: Handles complex server state synchronization automatically, critical for real-time business data

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid feature development with minimal infrastructure management
- Type safety reduces runtime errors in critical business logic
- Real-time data updates enhance collaborative workflows
- Edge Functions provide cost-effective AI processing

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in to Supabase ecosystem
- Limited control over database optimization
- Potential scaling constraints with Supabase limitations

## 2025-01-15: Target Market Focus

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Business  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Marketing Lead

### Decision

Focus exclusively on independent professionals, small business owners, and digital agencies (2-10 person teams) rather than pursuing enterprise market or individual consumers.

### Context

Initial market research revealed distinct needs between enterprise users (complex project management requirements) and individual consumers (simple task lists). The middle market of independent professionals showed strongest demand for sophisticated forecasting without enterprise complexity.

### Rationale

- **Market Size**: 57 million independent professionals in the US market alone
- **Pain Point Alignment**: Unique forecasting and client management needs not addressed by existing tools
- **Revenue Potential**: Higher willingness to pay than individual consumers, lower complexity than enterprise sales

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product focus enables targeted feature development
- Marketing messaging can address specific pain points
- Revenue model aligns with professional services pricing

**Negative:**
- Excludes potentially large enterprise market opportunities
- Limited scalability potential beyond small team market
- Competitive pressure from both enterprise and consumer tool providers

## 2025-01-10: AI Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement AI capabilities through OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and Perplexity API integration via Supabase Edge Functions, with explicit user consent and graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable.

### Context

AI capabilities essential for competitive differentiation in task forecasting, content generation, and intelligent prioritization. Required approach that balances functionality with cost control and user privacy.

### Rationale

- **Cost Efficiency**: GPT-4o-mini provides 80% of GPT-4 capabilities at 20% of the cost
- **Privacy Control**: Explicit user consent ensures compliance with privacy expectations
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation ensures core functionality remains available

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Competitive differentiation through intelligent automation
- Cost-effective AI processing suitable for small business pricing
- User trust through transparent AI usage policies

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external AI service availability and pricing
- Additional complexity in error handling and fallback scenarios
- Ongoing cost monitoring and optimization requirements

## 2025-01-30: Initial Product Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Build on React/TypeScript + Supabase stack with shadcn/ui component system and AI-first feature development approach.

### Context
Need to establish a solid technical foundation for a task forecasting platform targeting independent professionals. Must balance rapid development, maintainability, and AI integration capabilities.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid prototyping with modern React ecosystem
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Supabase provides full backend without infrastructure management
- shadcn/ui ensures consistent, accessible design system
- Strong foundation for AI feature integration

**Trade-offs:**
- Vendor lock-in with Supabase (mitigated by standard PostgreSQL)
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with React Query
- Additional complexity from TypeScript setup

## 2025-01-30: State Management Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002  
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Use React Query (@tanstack/react-query) as primary state management solution with optimized caching strategy.

### Context
Task forecasting requires real-time data updates, offline resilience, and complex data relationships. Traditional state management would require significant boilerplate for server state synchronization.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Automatic background refetching keeps data fresh
- Built-in loading and error states reduce UI complexity
- Optimistic updates improve perceived performance
- Query invalidation handles complex data dependencies

**Trade-offs:**
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with server state concepts
- More complex debugging compared to simple useState patterns
- Additional bundle size from React Query

## 2025-01-30: AI Integration Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Product

### Decision
Isolate AI functionality in `/services/ai/` with pluggable provider architecture to enable easy API swapping and feature experimentation.

### Context
AI is core to the product vision but technology landscape is rapidly evolving. Need architecture that allows experimentation with different providers while maintaining code quality.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Easy to swap between OpenAI, Claude, and other providers
- AI features can be developed independently
- Clear separation of concerns for non-AI developers
- Simplified testing and mocking of AI responses

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional abstraction layer adds complexity
- May over-engineer for current simple AI use cases
- Team needs to maintain provider abstraction discipline

## 2025-01-30: Component Architecture Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Adopt shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives with custom component library built on Tailwind CSS utility classes.

### Context
Need design system that provides consistency, accessibility, and rapid development while allowing customization for unique product requirements.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Accessible components by default (WCAG compliance)
- Consistent design language across application
- Rapid UI development with pre-built patterns
- Easy customization with Tailwind utility classes
- Strong community support and documentation

**Trade-offs:**
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Radix patterns
- Bundle size increase from comprehensive component library
- Design constraints from pre-built component patterns

## 2025-01-30: Data Architecture & Forecasting Focus

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product

### Decision
Pivot from general business management platform to focused task forecasting and productivity optimization tool for independent professionals.

### Context
Analysis shows strongest product-market fit opportunity in task forecasting space. Current feature set provides good foundation but needs focus on core value proposition.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear target market and use case definition
- Focused feature development reduces scope creep
- Stronger competitive positioning against generic tools
- Enables AI-powered features that are highly relevant to core workflow

**Trade-offs:**
- May alienate current users expecting broader business management
- Requires significant UX/UI refactoring to emphasize forecasting
- Some existing features may need to be deprecated or repositioned

## 2025-01-30: Mobile Strategy

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Proposed
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Develop mobile-responsive web application first, then evaluate React Native/Flutter for native app based on user feedback and adoption metrics.

### Context
Users need mobile access for task management but development resources are limited. Must balance user experience with development efficiency.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Single codebase reduces maintenance burden
- Faster time to market for mobile experience
- Progressive Web App capabilities provide native-like features
- Can evaluate mobile usage patterns before native investment

**Trade-offs:**
- Web app performance limitations compared to native
- Limited access to device features (notifications, calendar deep integration)
- May not feel as polished as native apps to users

## 2025-01-30: AI Ethics & Data Privacy

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Business

### Decision
Implement privacy-first AI features with explicit user consent for data processing and clear data retention policies.

### Context
AI features require processing user task data and work patterns. Must maintain user trust while enabling powerful AI assistance features.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Builds user trust and confidence in platform
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Competitive advantage over platforms with unclear data practices
- Foundation for future enterprise sales

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional development overhead for privacy controls
- May limit AI feature effectiveness with restricted data access
- Requires ongoing compliance monitoring and updates
- Could slow feature development velocity

## 2025-01-30: Monetization Strategy

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Business

### Decision
Launch with freemium model: free tier for basic task management, paid tiers for AI features, forecasting, and client reporting.

### Context
Need to balance user acquisition with revenue generation. AI features provide clear value differentiation for paid tiers.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Low barrier to entry increases user acquisition
- AI features justify premium pricing
- Clear upgrade path as users see value
- Potential for high lifetime value from engaged users

**Trade-offs:**
- Must maintain two code paths (free vs. paid features)
- Risk of users never upgrading from free tier
- Support costs for free users without revenue offset
- Complex feature flagging and billing integration required

## Error Handling Philosophy

Red Baez Business Suite prioritizes **graceful degradation** and **user-friendly error communication**. Since our users are busy independent professionals, errors should be:
- **Clearly communicated** without technical jargon
- **Actionable** with specific steps to resolve
- **Non-blocking** where possible to maintain workflow continuity

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Automatic Recovery
- **Network Issues**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Temporary Service Outages**: Queue operations for retry
- **Rate Limits**: Intelligent backoff based on service limits
- **Memory Issues**: Automatic cache clearing and optimization

### User-Assisted Recovery
- **Authentication**: Guided re-login process
- **Data Conflicts**: Clear merge interface with preview
- **Integration Issues**: Step-by-step re-connection wizard
- **Performance Problems**: Optimization suggestions and tools

### Fallback Modes
- **Offline Task Management**: Local storage with sync queue
- **Manual Content Creation**: When AI services unavailable
- **Read-Only Mode**: When write operations fail but data viewing works
- **Basic Functionality**: Core features when advanced features fail

## Error Communication Guidelines

### Message Tone
- **Professional but friendly**: "We're working on this" not "Error occurred"
- **Action-oriented**: Always provide next steps
- **Honest about timeline**: Give realistic expectations for fixes
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge impact on user's work

### Technical Details
- **For Developers**: Full error details with stack traces
- **For Users**: Simplified explanations with clear actions
- **For Support**: Error IDs and context for troubleshooting
- **For Monitoring**: Structured logs with relevant metadata

## Error Monitoring and Analytics

### Error Tracking
- **Sentry Integration**: Automatic error reporting with context
- **User Impact Measurement**: How many users affected by each error type
- **Error Trends**: Identify patterns and recurring issues
- **Performance Impact**: Correlate errors with app performance

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical Errors**: > 1% of users affected in 5 minutes
- **Service Outages**: Any 503/504 errors from Supabase
- **AI Service Issues**: > 20% timeout rate for AI requests
- **Build Failures**: Any failed deployments

### Recovery Metrics
- **Time to Recovery**: How quickly users can resume work
- **User Retention**: Do errors cause users to abandon sessions?
- **Support Burden**: Which errors generate the most support requests
- **Fix Effectiveness**: Do error fixes prevent recurrence?

## Implementation Patterns

### React Error Boundaries
```typescript
// High-level error boundary for route-level failures
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<GlobalErrorFallback />}>
  <Router>
    <Routes>...</Routes>
  </Router>
</ErrorBoundary>

// Feature-level boundaries for isolated failures
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<FeatureErrorFallback />}>
  <AIForecastingComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### React Query Error Handling
```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        // Don't retry auth failures
        if (error.status === 401) return false;
        // Retry network errors up to 3 times
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        // Global error handling
        handleQueryError(error);
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Supabase Error Handling
```typescript
const handleSupabaseError = (error: PostgrestError) => {
  switch (error.code) {
    case 'PGRST116': // No rows returned
      return 'No data found';
    case '23505': // Unique violation
      return 'This item already exists';
    default:
      return 'Something went wrong. Please try again.';
  }
};
```

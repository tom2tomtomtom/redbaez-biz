## Deployment Checklist Execution

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Run automated checks** - Execute all test commands and verify passing
2. **Manual testing** - Complete critical user flow testing
3. **Performance verification** - Check bundle size and load times
4. **Security review** - Verify no secrets exposed, dependencies updated
5. **Accessibility testing** - Basic screen reader and keyboard navigation test

### Deployment Process
1. **Environment variables configured** - Production secrets properly set
2. **Database migrations applied** - Schema changes deployed to production DB
3. **Edge functions updated** - Supabase functions deployed with latest code
4. **CDN cache cleared** - Static assets refreshed if changed
5. **Monitoring activated** - Error tracking and performance monitoring enabled

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. **Smoke tests** - Verify core functionality works in production
2. **Performance monitoring** - Check real-world load times and errors
3. **User feedback monitoring** - Watch for user reports or support requests  
4. **AI service monitoring** - Verify AI features working in production
5. **Database performance** - Check query performance and connection health

## Rollback Criteria

Deploy should be **immediately rolled back** if:
- **Core functionality broken** - Users cannot complete primary workflows
- **Data loss occurring** - Any indication of data corruption or loss
- **Security breach detected** - Unauthorized access or data exposure
- **Performance severely degraded** - Load times > 10 seconds consistently
- **High error rates** - > 5% of requests failing in first hour

## Quality Metrics Tracking

### Success Indicators
- **Zero critical bugs** in first 24 hours post-deployment
- **Page load times** remain under 3 seconds
- **User task completion rates** maintain or improve
- **AI feature usage** remains consistent with previous deployment
- **Support ticket volume** doesn't increase significantly

### Warning Signs
- **Increased bounce rate** - Users leaving without completing actions
- **Slower task completion** - Users taking longer to complete workflows
- **Increased error rates** - More than usual API or database errors
- **AI service issues** - Higher timeout or failure rates for AI features
- **Mobile experience problems** - Increased mobile-specific error reports
